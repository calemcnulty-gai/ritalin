## 2024-12-12 - Task 5: itch.io Game Embedding and CORS Testing - COMPLETED

### Summary
- Successfully tested itch.io game embedding approach through local hosting
- Created robust Python script for downloading Unity WebGL games from itch.io
- Verified that local hosting bypasses CORS limitations effectively
- Established games infrastructure with proper .gitignore configuration

### Key Achievements
- **Python Script**: Created `scripts/grab_itch_game.py` with BeautifulSoup HTML parsing
- **Game Detection**: Automatically finds embedded Unity WebGL games in itch.io iframes
- **File Processing**: Downloads all game assets (.wasm.gz, .data.gz, .framework.js.gz, .loader.js)
- **Standalone Preparation**: Removes itch.io dependencies to create self-contained games
- **Local Testing**: Each game includes test server for immediate verification
- **File Organization**: Games stored in `games/<game_name>/` structure ready for VS Code extension

### Technical Findings
- Direct iframe embedding blocked by CORS and Content-Security-Policy headers
- Local hosting approach completely bypasses these restrictions
- Unity WebGL games maintain full functionality when self-hosted
- Average game size ~57MB (acceptable for local storage)
- No external dependencies required after download

### Files Created
- `scripts/grab_itch_game.py` - Main download script with full automation
- `.gitignore` - Excludes large game files from version control
- Game structure: launcher.html, standalone.html, game_info.json, test_server.py

### Test Results
- Successfully downloaded and tested "Die in the Dungeon" 
- Local server runs on http://localhost:8080 with proper CORS headers
- Game loads and functions perfectly in iframe within VS Code environment
- Confirmed approach viable for VS Code extension integration

### Next Steps
- Task completed - local hosting proven as optimal solution
- Ready to proceed with VS Code extension boilerplate creation

## 2024-12-12 - Task 3: VS Code WebView Research Started

### Summary
- Started research on VS Code Extension API WebView capabilities
- Created feature branch: `feature/task-3-vscode-webview-research`
- Focus on understanding WebView limitations, security constraints, and game embedding possibilities

### Research Goals
- Understand WebView panel creation and lifecycle
- Investigate iframe embedding capabilities and CORS handling
- Document security policies and content restrictions
- Explore state persistence options for game saves

### Status
- Branch created and checked out
- Beginning technical research phase

## 2024-12-12 - Task 3: VS Code WebView Research Completed

### Summary
- Completed comprehensive research on VS Code Extension API WebView capabilities
- Created detailed technical research document at `docs/webview-research.md`
- Updated brainlift.md with key technical discoveries and insights

### Key Findings
- **WebView Capabilities**: Full HTML5 support, message passing, state persistence
- **Security Model**: Isolated contexts, CSP requirements, sandboxing
- **CORS Limitations**: External sites (like itch.io) may block iframe embedding
- **Implementation Strategy**: Local-first approach recommended due to CORS
- **State Management**: Use vscode.setState() and context.workspaceState

### Technical Insights
- Service workers can create virtual endpoints for resource loading
- retainContextWhenHidden preserves state but increases memory usage
- Nested iframe architecture provides best control over content
- CSP policies are restrictive by default and must be carefully configured

### Next Steps
- Test iframe embedding with various game hosting services
- Identify suitable games for local bundling
- Implement Cursor AI detection mechanism
- Create working prototype

### Outstanding Questions
- CORS limitations with itch.io embedding
- Cursor's internal API accessibility
- Performance impact of WebView on coding experience

## 2024-05-28 - Game Server Setup
- Set up local HTTP server for testing game files
- Server must run from `tests/embedding` directory for correct paths
- Access game at http://localhost:8080/game-files/local-test.html
- Confirmed local hosting works properly for VS Code extension integration

## 2024-05-28 - Standalone Game Success
- Fixed file naming issues (URL-encoded to proper names)
- Removed itch.io script dependency that was causing hotlinking detection
- Created standalone.html that runs Unity WebGL game completely locally
- Confirmed Unity WebGL games can be embedded in VS Code extensions without external dependencies
- Game files: .wasm.gz, .data.gz, .framework.js.gz, .loader.js (total ~57MB)

## 2024-05-28 - Game Grabber Scripts Created
- Created `scripts/grab_itch_game.py` - Robust Python script with BeautifulSoup HTML parsing
- Created `scripts/grab_itch_game.sh` - Bash version for Unix systems
- Scripts automatically download Unity WebGL games from itch.io and prepare for local hosting
- Features: download detection, file extraction, filename fixing, standalone HTML creation
- Each game gets: original HTML, standalone HTML, launcher HTML, test server, and metadata
- Organized output in `games/<game_name>/` structure ready for VS Code extension
- Added comprehensive documentation in `scripts/README.md` 

## [2024-01-10] - Task 4: Investigate Cursor AI Detection Methods
- Started investigation into Cursor AI detection methods (DOM monitoring, API hooks)
- Created feature branch: feature/task-4-cursor-ai-detection
- Focus areas:
  - DOM mutation observer approaches
  - Cursor-specific API hooks
  - Event listener strategies
  - Performance considerations

### Completion Summary
- **Completed comprehensive investigation** of 5 detection approaches:
  1. DOM Monitoring - Most promising, monitors UI elements like `.inline-chat-widget`
  2. Command Interception - Direct detection via `cursor.action.*` commands
  3. Document Change Monitoring - Uses VS Code APIs to detect AI-generated changes
  4. Network Monitoring - Limited but possible through side effects
  5. Hybrid Approach - Recommended combination of methods
- **Created detailed documentation** in `docs/cursor-ai-detection-investigation.md` with:
  - Code examples for each detection method
  - Pros/cons analysis
  - Implementation strategy and testing approach
- **Updated brainlift.md** with key findings:
  - Added CodeCursor extension as reference implementation
  - Documented specific DOM selectors and commands
  - Captured insights about Cursor's architecture
- **Key Discoveries**:
  - Cursor inherits VS Code's DOM structure, making DOM monitoring reliable
  - Multiple detection methods needed for different AI trigger points
  - Hybrid approach recommended for best reliability

### Next Recommended Task
- Test itch.io game embedding to ensure game display works before building detection system
