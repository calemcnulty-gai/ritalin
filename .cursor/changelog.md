## 2024-12-12 - Project Inception

### Summary
- Created initial project concept for "Ritalin for Cursor" extension
- Established project goal: Keep developers focused during AI generation by displaying mini-games
- Selected "Die in the Dungeon" as the initial game integration

### Key Decisions
- **Architecture**: VS Code extension with WebView for game display
- **Detection Method**: Will research both DOM monitoring and API hooks for Cursor AI detection
- **Game Display**: Floating, draggable window approach preferred over sidebar integration
- **MVP Scope**: Single game, basic show/hide functionality, no statistics initially

### Documents Created
- PRD.md - Comprehensive Product Requirements Document
- project_plan.md - Detailed task breakdown across 9 phases
- Initial project structure established

### Next Steps
- Research VS Code Extension API capabilities
- Test itch.io embedding feasibility
- Create basic extension boilerplate

### Outstanding Questions
- CORS limitations with itch.io embedding
- Cursor's internal API accessibility
- Performance impact of WebView on coding experience

## [2024-01-10] - Task 4: Investigate Cursor AI Detection Methods
- Started investigation into Cursor AI detection methods (DOM monitoring, API hooks)
- Created feature branch: feature/task-4-cursor-ai-detection
- Focus areas:
  - DOM mutation observer approaches
  - Cursor-specific API hooks
  - Event listener strategies
  - Performance considerations

### Completion Summary
- **Completed comprehensive investigation** of 5 detection approaches:
  1. DOM Monitoring - Most promising, monitors UI elements like `.inline-chat-widget`
  2. Command Interception - Direct detection via `cursor.action.*` commands
  3. Document Change Monitoring - Uses VS Code APIs to detect AI-generated changes
  4. Network Monitoring - Limited but possible through side effects
  5. Hybrid Approach - Recommended combination of methods
- **Created detailed documentation** in `docs/cursor-ai-detection-investigation.md` with:
  - Code examples for each detection method
  - Pros/cons analysis
  - Implementation strategy and testing approach
- **Updated brainlift.md** with key findings:
  - Added CodeCursor extension as reference implementation
  - Documented specific DOM selectors and commands
  - Captured insights about Cursor's architecture
- **Key Discoveries**:
  - Cursor inherits VS Code's DOM structure, making DOM monitoring reliable
  - Multiple detection methods needed for different AI trigger points
  - Hybrid approach recommended for best reliability

### Next Recommended Task
- Test itch.io game embedding to ensure game display works before building detection system
