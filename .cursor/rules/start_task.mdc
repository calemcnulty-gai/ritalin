# Start Task Rule

## Description
This rule defines the workflow that must be followed when starting work on a new task from the project plan.

## Trigger Conditions
This rule MUST be triggered when ANY of these conditions are met:
- User explicitly states they want to start a new task
- User asks to proceed with the next task
- User mentions "new task" or "start task"
- User asks about what to do next
- User requests to begin work on a task
- User asks to continue with the project
- User wants to know what's next in the project plan
- User asks to move forward with development

## Rule Application
When triggered, the agent MUST follow these steps in order:

1. Verify Prerequisites
   - Check current branch status
   - Ensure all previous tasks are fully completed
   - Checkout main branch and pull latest changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. Create Feature Branch
   - Create and checkout new feature branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/task-{number}-{brief-description}
     ```
   - Confirm branch creation and current branch

3. Update Project Documentation
   - Update project_plan.md to mark task as "In Progress"
   - Add entry to changelog.md noting task start
   - Include current date and branch name

4. Begin Implementation
   - Start implementing the task requirements
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow the existing project structure and patterns
- Implement features incrementally with regular commits
- Update documentation as you progress
- Keep the changelog current with significant changes

## Expected Outcomes
- New feature branch created and checked out
- Project plan updated with task status
- Changelog updated with task start entry
- Clear understanding of task requirements and approach
