# Finish Task Rule

## Description
This rule defines the workflow that must be followed when finishing work on a task from the project plan.

## Trigger Conditions
This rule MUST be triggered when ANY of these conditions are met:
- User explicitly states a task is complete or finished
- User asks to mark a task as done
- User requests to create a pull request for a task
- User says they want to close or wrap up a task
- User asks to finalize or complete a task

## Rule Application
When triggered, the agent MUST follow these steps in order:

1. Review Changes
   - Run `git diff main` to review all changes
   - Verify that changes match task requirements in project plan
   - Fix any deficiencies (not nice-to-haves) found during review

2. Update Documentation
   - Update task status in [project_plan.md](mdc:.cursor/project_plan.md) to "Done"
   - Update [changelog.md](mdc:.cursor/changelog.md) with completion details
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects the actual implementation

3. Create Pull Request
   - Commit any fixes from the review
   - Push changes to the feature branch
   - Create a pull request using the gh cli tool
   - Include a summary of changes and verification steps taken
      - No newlines or fancy formatting. Plain text, a few sentences.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Only fix actual deficiencies found during review, not nice-to-haves
- Document any known limitations or future improvements in the PR description
- Follow the project's existing code style and patterns
