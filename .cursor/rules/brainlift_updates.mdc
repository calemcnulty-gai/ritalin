# Brainlift Update Rule

When discovering new information about the Ritalin project, update `/brainlift.md`:

- **Experts**: Add new resources, communities, or documentation links
- **Knowledge Tree**: Document technical findings, API discoveries, or implementation approaches
- **Insights**: Capture "aha moments" or important realizations
- **Spiky POVs**: Note controversial ideas or unconventional approaches

Keep entries concise. Focus on information that would help future development.
