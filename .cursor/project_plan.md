#### Task 10: Cursor AI Detection Implementation
**Status: DONE** - feature/task-10-cursor-ai-detection
- [x] Research Cursor-specific DOM patterns and API calls
- [x] Research VS Code extension API limitations and security model
- [x] Implement multi-method AI detection framework with 4 active detection methods:
  - [x] **AI Self-Reporting** (Tier 1 - 99%/1% confidence) - AI edits .cursor/is_working file
  - [x] **Document Change Analysis** (50-95% confidence) - Detects rapid text changes
  - [x] **Selection Change Monitoring** (50% confidence) - Monitors cursor/selection patterns
  - [x] **Chat/Focus Change Detection** (15-40% confidence) - Detects editor focus changes
- [x] Disable fundamentally unviable methods:
  - [x] ~~DOM Monitoring~~ - DISABLED (webview crashes)
  - [x] ~~Command Interception~~ - DISABLED (API limitation)
  - [x] ~~Status Bar Monitoring~~ - DISABLED (extension isolation)
  - [x] ~~File System Monitoring~~ - DISABLED (performance/crash issues)
  - [x] ~~Language Server Protocol Monitoring~~ - DISABLED (Cursor AI bypasses standard LSP)
- [x] Implement AI self-reporting system with .cursor/is_working file and Cursor rule
- [x] Add 60-second timeout safety mechanism for AI detection
- [x] Create comprehensive output channel logging for debugging
- [x] Remove dashboard in favor of direct game window show/hide
- [x] Clean up test code and unused detection methods
- [x] Remove StatusBarManager and simplify extension architecture
- [x] Package size optimization (6MB+ â†’ 2.59MB via .vscodeignore)
- [x] **Auto-initialization for new projects** - Extension creates required .cursor files
- [x] **Filename correction** - Fixed all references from .cursor/.is_working â†’ .cursor/is_working
- [x] **COMPLETED: Production-ready AI detection with automatic game show/hide**

#### Live Testing Results Summary
- **âœ… AI Self-Reporting**: PRIMARY detection method (99%/1% confidence)
  - Extension auto-creates .cursor/is_working file in new projects
  - File watcher monitors for AI activity state changes
  - 60-second timeout safety mechanism prevents stuck states
- **âœ… Document Change Analysis**: SECONDARY detection method (50-95% confidence)
  - Detects large, rapid text changes characteristic of AI generation
  - Working as backup detection for non-compliant AI interactions
- **ðŸ”§ Selection & Chat Detection**: AUXILIARY methods (15-50% confidence)
  - Provide additional signals but not primary detection
  - Used for confidence scoring and edge case handling

#### Task 11: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize WebView resource loading
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for game assets  
- [ ] Add memory management for game instances
- [ ] Test extension impact on Cursor performance

### Phase 3: Polish and Distribution

#### Task 11.5: Prune Deprecated Game Panel Code
**Status: DONE**
- **Objective**: Remove all code related to the deprecated WebView panel to streamline the codebase.
- **Action Items**:
  - [x] **Delete `src/gamePanelView.ts`**: This file contains the `GamePanelViewProvider`, which is no longer needed.
  - [x] **Refactor `src/extension.ts`**: 
    - [x] Remove the import for `GamePanelViewProvider`.
    - [x] Remove the instantiation and registration of `GamePanelViewProvider`.
    - [x] Remove any commands specifically related to toggling the panel view (e.g., `ritalin.toggleGame`).
  - [x] **Update `package.json`**:
    - [x] Remove the `ritalin.toggleGame` command from `contributes.commands`.
    - [x] Remove the `ritalin` view container from `contributes.viewsContainers`.
    - [x] Remove the `ritalin.gameView` from `contributes.views`.
    - [x] Remove the `ritalin.showResizeTip` configuration from `contributes.configuration`.

#### Task 12: Post-Install & Configuration Experience
**Status: Done** âœ…
- **Objective**: Create a seamless and intuitive post-install and configuration experience.
- **Action Items**:
  - [x] On first install, automatically open a custom configuration page in a new editor tab.
  - [x] Design and implement the configuration page as a webview.
  - [x] The configuration page should provide a clear "getting started" guide.
  - [x] Display curated popular turn-based games from itch.io with real thumbnails.
  - [x] Implement a game search bar directly on the configuration page.
  - [x] The game search should have live typeahead functionality, showing results as the user types.
  - [x] Add smart button states: Download â†’ Select â†’ âœ“ Selected
  - [x] Fix game download functionality with proper Python script integration
  - [x] Package real game images from itch.io in the extension
  - [x] Add proper configuration registration for selectedGame setting
  - [x] Implement game selection functionality with UI feedback

#### Task 13: Extension Distribution
- [ ] Prepare extension for Cursor marketplace (if available)
- [ ] Create installation and setup documentation
- [ ] Set up automated builds and releases
- [ ] Plan user feedback and iteration cycle

## Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint 4**: Production Testing & Performance Optimization (Task 10 â†’ Task 11 transition)
- **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE**: Test complete AI detection system with auto-game triggering
- **SECONDARY OBJECTIVE**: Validate AI self-reporting system across different project types
- **TERTIARY OBJECTIVE**: Begin Performance Optimization (Task 11) if testing successful

## Recent Completions
- **âœ… Auto-file Creation**: Extension now creates .cursor/rules/ai-activity-reporting.mdc and .cursor/is_working in new projects
- **âœ… Filename Fix**: Corrected all references from .cursor/.is_working â†’ .cursor/is_working (removed dot prefix)
- **âœ… Workspace Detection**: Added workspace change listener to re-initialize files when switching projects
- **ðŸ“¦ Packaged & Installed**: v0.1.0 ready for production testing

## Notes
- Priority is on MVP functionality before adding advanced features
- Must test thoroughly with actual Cursor usage patterns
- Consider beta testing with small group before public release
