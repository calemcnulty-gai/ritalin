# Ritalin for Cursor

- Owners
  - Cale McNulty
- Purpose
  - Developers waste 5-10 minutes per context switch when waiting for AI code generation, destroying flow state and productivity. Current wait times of 15-60 seconds trigger habitual tab switching to social media.
  - We'll keep developers focused by automatically displaying engaging mini-games during AI generation periods, transforming dead time into productive micro-gaming sessions without leaving the IDE.
  - In scope
    - Detecting Cursor AI generation states
    - Embedding web-based games in WebView panels (using VS Code extension API)
    - State persistence between gaming sessions
    - Focus metrics and productivity tracking
  - Out of scope
    - Other IDEs or AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot in VS Code, etc.)
    - Desktop/mobile apps outside Cursor
    - Building custom games (using existing web games)
    - Multiplayer or social features (MVP)

  - Game Integration Approaches
    - Iframe: For embedding external content (itch.io games)
      - CORS Challenge: Many sites block embedding, need Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
      - Workaround: Bundle games locally or use permissive hosts
    - Direct HTML: For custom mini-games
    - Canvas/WebGL: For performance-critical games
  - State Management
    - WebView State: Use vscode.setState() for game progress persistence
    - Extension State: context.workspaceState for statistics and settings
    - Auto-pause: Implement when WebView is hidden to save resources
  - Performance Optimization
    - Lazy load game resources
    - Dispose WebViews when not needed
    - Limit concurrent WebView instances
    - Use local resources whenever possible
  - Security
    - Always validate message data between WebView and extension
    - Use strict CSP policies
    - Limit localResourceRoots to specific directories
    - Sanitize any user input
  - VS Code Extension Development
    - **WebView API**: `vscode.window.createWebviewPanel()` creates isolated HTML contexts
    - **Extension Lifecycle**: `activate()` called on extension load, `deactivate()` on unload
    - **Command Registration**: `vscode.commands.registerCommand()` for user-invokable actions
    - **Configuration**: `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration()` for user settings
    - **TypeScript Setup**: Requires @types/vscode, proper tsconfig.json, and compilation to out/ directory
    - **Packaging**: vsce (VS Code Extension CLI) creates .vsix files for distribution
    - **File Exclusion**: .vscodeignore controls what gets included in package (critical for size)
    - **Activation Events**: onStartupFinished, onCommand, etc. control when extension loads
  - Cursor AI Detection Methods
- Insights
  - The problem isn't the wait time itself, it's what developers do during the wait time
  - Context switching during AI generation breaks flow state more than the generation delay
  - Mini-games provide structured distraction that maintains engagement without deep context switching
  - VS Code extensions have surprisingly robust capabilities for embedding interactive content
  - WebView panels provide complete HTML5 environment suitable for game embedding
  - Micro-gaming sessions can maintain cognitive engagement without deep context switching
  - Game state persistence is crucial - nobody wants to restart from level 1 every time
  - Attention != Productivity: Sometimes a strategic distraction improves overall output
  - Flow State Preservation: Games can maintain engagement during necessary waits
  - State Management Critical: Must handle show/hide cycles gracefully
  - **CORS is Absolute**: itch.io and most game hosts have strict CSP policies that cannot be bypassed through browser tricks
  - **Local Hosting is Perfect**: Self-hosting Unity WebGL games eliminates all CORS issues and provides full control
  - **Game Size Acceptable**: Unity WebGL games (~50-100MB) are reasonable for local storage in modern development environments
  - **Automation Possible**: Can reliably extract and download games from itch.io using iframe URL detection and asset parsing
  - **Cursor Uses VS Code Engine**: Cursor is a VS Code fork and uses the same extension API and engine specifications in package.json
  - **Cursor-Specific Detection Required**: While the extension API is the same, we need to detect Cursor's specific AI generation states, not generic VS Code behavior
  - **Version Compatibility**: Current Cursor builds are based on VS Code 1.93.1, so engine specification should target compatible versions
  - **Preloading is the Answer**: Games should load on extension startup and stay running in background, not on-demand. Show/hide is just CSS visibility control. No loading delays, no offline complexity, simple and fast.
  - **Internet Dependency is Fine**: Cursor requires internet for AI models anyway, so offline support is unnecessary complexity
  - **WebView Persistence**: retainContextWhenHidden keeps games running even when panels are hidden, perfect for instant show/hide
  - **Unity WebGL Incompatible with WebView**: Unity games require service workers and complex asset loading that fail in VS Code's WebView security model. The CSP restrictions and sandboxing make Unity WebGL games unviable.
  - **Panel Visibility != Content Visibility**: VS Code API doesn't provide direct panel hide/show methods. Current implementation controls content visibility via CSS, not the actual panel frame.
  - **Bottom Panel Requires Different API**: True bottom panel (like Terminal) needs WebView View API, not WebView Panel API. This would be a significant refactoring.
- Spiky POVs
  - Most "productivity" tools try to eliminate distractions, but strategic distraction within the IDE is actually better than uncontrolled context switching
  - The future of AI coding isn't faster generation, it's better utilization of generation time
  - Gamification of waiting could become a standard IDE feature, not just an extension
  - This could evolve into a platform for indie game developers to reach programmer audiences
  - The data on "productive waiting time" could reveal insights about AI coding patterns and optimal work sessions
- Other Brainlifts
  - [To be added as project evolves]

## Technical Discoveries

### itch.io Game Extraction
- **iframe Detection**: itch.io embeds games in iframe elements with specific URL patterns
- **Asset Parsing**: Unity WebGL games have predictable asset structure (.loader.js, .framework.js.gz, .data.gz, .wasm.gz)
- **URL Encoding**: Build directory often contains URL-encoded filenames that need decoding
- **Dependency Removal**: itch.io scripts can be safely removed for standalone operation
- **BeautifulSoup Parsing**: Python script can reliably extract embedded game URLs and download assets

### Unity WebGL Architecture
- **Self-Contained**: Once downloaded, games are completely self-contained
- **CORS Headers**: Local test server needs specific headers for proper WebAssembly loading
- **File Structure**: Predictable build output makes automation possible
- **Resource Loading**: All assets load via relative paths, making local hosting straightforward
- **WebView Incompatibility**: Unity's requirement for service workers and complex asset loading patterns conflict with VS Code WebView's security model
- **File Size Issues**: 34MB+ Unity builds may be too large for extension distribution
- **Alternative Needed**: Must pivot to lightweight HTML5/Canvas games that work within WebView constraints

### WebView Architecture
- Nested iframe structure provides best control
- Service workers can implement virtual endpoints for resource loading
- CSP inheritance can be problematic for inline content
- **Panel Types**: WebView Panel API creates editor tabs, WebView View API creates sidebar/bottom panels
- **Visibility Control**: No direct API to hide panel frame - only content visibility or focus switching
- **State Persistence**: `retainContextWhenHidden: true` maintains WebView state when panel is backgrounded

### Panel Management Discoveries
- **No Direct Hide Method**: VS Code API lacks panel.hide() - must use workarounds
- **Editor Panels**: Created with `createWebviewPanel`, appear as tabs in editor area
- **Bottom Panels**: Require `registerWebviewViewProvider` and manifest changes
- **Visibility Options**: 
  - Dispose/recreate (loses state)
  - Focus switching (panel remains in tab bar)
  - Minimize panel area (for bottom panels only)
- **Best Practice**: Use `retainContextWhenHidden` and control content visibility, not panel visibility

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load game resources
- Dispose WebViews when not needed
- Limit concurrent WebView instances
- Use local resources whenever possible
